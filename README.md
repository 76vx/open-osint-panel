# Open Osint Panel

This project is still in development but it works, although it's missing some features like validation and a more attractive results UI.

It can be used to obtain IP address information since that part is completely finished, but it needs some polishing and additional features.

## Current Features
* Display country
* Display ISP
* Display ASN

## Planned Improvements
* Improved user experience
* Real-time WHOIS
* Results caching
* Rate limit
* Input validation
