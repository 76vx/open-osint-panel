# Open OSINT Panel - Deployment Status

The project is now 100% functional and error-free.

A detailed, step-by-step guide for the README.md will be updated later today. However, for users experienced with Node.js environments, the deployment process is standard:

1. Navigate to the project directory: cd open-osint-panel
2. Execute the application: node server/server.js

The system is fully operational. Comprehensive documentation and usage instructions will be finalized and uploaded this afternoon.
