# Open Osint Panel

This project is currently in development. While the core engine for IP data retrieval is fully functional, the project is undergoing active refinement regarding input validation and UI/UX optimization.

At its current stage, the tool is fully capable of obtaining IP address information, though it is being polished for a more professional deployment.

## Core Capabilities
* **Geographic Mapping:** Country-level identification.
* **Network Intelligence:** Full ISP and ASN data retrieval.
* **Status:** Operational (v1.0-alpha).

## Technical Roadmap
* **Advanced UI:** Implementation of a professional dark mode interface.
* **OSINT Visualization:** Relationship graphing and data correlation.
* **Real-time WHOIS:** Live registration data integration.
* **Performance:** Results caching and optimized rate limiting.
* **Production Ready:** Public deployment and robust input validation.

## Current Usage
The IP information module is completely finished and can be used to query network metadata. Future updates will focus on the visual representation of these results and system stability.
