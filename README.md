# Open OSINT Panel - Status Update

The project is currently undergoing maintenance and internal refactoring.

### Current Status
* IP/Domain Validation: Temporarily disabled.
* Graphical Interface: Under development (Graph-based visualization).
* Known Issue: A recent update caused a regression in the IP location display logic.

### Next Steps
The system is being debugged to restore full functionality. A stable redeploy is expected later today.

The core IP intelligence module remains the priority for the next release, including the final polish of the new professional dark UI and OSINT relationship graphs.
